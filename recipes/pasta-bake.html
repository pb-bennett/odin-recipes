    <p>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180 Fan/Gas 6. </li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a flameproof casserole. Add the onion, pepper, courgette and aubergine, season with a little salt and lots of pepper and fry over a medium heat for about 8 minutes, or until softened and lightly browned, stirring regularly. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, then stir in the pesto and cook for 1 minute more, stirring constantly.</li>
            <li>Tip the tomatoes into the casserole, then fill the tomato tin with water and pour into the pan. Add the pasta and bring to a simmer, stirring regularly. Cover with a lid, or if you prefer tip into a baking dish and cover with foil, and bake for 20 minutes. </li>
            <li>Take the casserole out of the oven and stir in the spinach, a handful at a time. Once all the spinach has been mixed in, sprinkle the cheese and pine nuts over the top. Return to the oven and cook, uncovered, for a further 10 minutes, until the pasta is tender.</li>
        </ol>
